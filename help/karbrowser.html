<h1>KarBrowser</h1>

<p>The KAR browser is a graphical utility to browse through and open
the historical records kept by the Kstat Activity Reporter.</p>

<p>The list on the left shows the available files, each keeping one
days worth of archival data. By default, these are found in the
<code>/var/adm/ka</code> directory.</p>

<p>Selecting a file loads it into the Kstat Browser and Kstat Chart
Builder, available in tabs in the right-hand panel.</p>
